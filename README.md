# Computation Corner (WIP)

<em>Computation Corner</em> is an ongoing, personal project that contains a collection of information relating to data structures and algorithms. Such information includes a glossary, as well as problems and solutions.

I'm building Computation Corner with the intentions of having it serve as both a direct DSA resource, and a space to record the logic involved in solving various problems.
